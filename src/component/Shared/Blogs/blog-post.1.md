# Love One Another

The Ark of Safety Fellowship Association Church is the original church body of the Ark family. It is an
inter-faith-non denomination universal church body(family). This original church was founded by Rev.
Doris Tongo in 1999. This church body was founded in the Bronx, New York. The Ark Victory Apostolic
church is our new church body located in Waynesboro, Georgia.

The two churches have emerged. Rev.
Doris Tongo is the Pastor. We believe in the Sacred Gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe in Togetherness as
a community. (Family) Our programs are taught from our Community Development Center. The Ark
Realty and Construction is our Real estate arm and we have a United Federation of Churches as our
Association arm. The Ark Caring Program is a Supportive Living Program. Al these programs need to be
highlighted.
